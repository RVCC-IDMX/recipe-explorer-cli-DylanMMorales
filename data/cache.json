Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water, and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times until the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don’t overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky.\r\nOn a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm. Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold, then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.\r\nTo make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.\r\nTo make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it’s just a little thicker than a £1 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place on a baking tray. Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4).\r\nHeat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wtqrqw1511639627.jpg","strTags":"Snack,Treat","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV0QCJ0GD5w","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Plain Flour","strIngredient3":"Lemon","strIngredient4":"Butter","strIngredient5":"Currants","strIngredient6":"Mixed Peel","strIngredient7":"Muscovado Sugar","strIngredient8":"Cinnamon","strIngredient9":"Ginger","strIngredient10":"Allspice","strIngredient11":"Lemon","strIngredient12":"Eggs","strIngredient13":"Sugar","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"250g","strMeasure2":"350g","strMeasure3":"Juice of 1/2","strMeasure4":"25g","strMeasure5":"200g","strMeasure6":"50g","strMeasure7":"100g ","strMeasure8":"1 tsp ","strMeasure9":"1 tsp ","strMeasure10":"1 tsp ","strMeasure11":"Zest of 1","strMeasure12":"1 beaten","strMeasure13":"spinkling","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/786659/eccles-cakes","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52895","strMeal":"English Breakfast","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Breakfast","strArea":"British","strInstructions":"Heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil.\r\nCook the sausages first. Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nSnip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nFor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.\r\nFor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.\r\nFor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.\r\nFor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.\r\nFor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.\r\nOnce all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/utxryw1511721587.jpg","strTags":"Breakfast","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXjYU2Ensck","strIngredient1":"Sausages","strIngredient2":"Bacon","strIngredient3":"Mushrooms","strIngredient4":"Tomatoes","strIngredient5":"Black Pudding","strIngredient6":"Eggs","strIngredient7":"Bread","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"2","strMeasure2":"3","strMeasure3":"2","strMeasure4":"2","strMeasure5":"1 Slice","strMeasure6":"2","strMeasure7":"1 Slice","strMeasure8":"","strMeasure9":"","strMeasure10":"","strMeasure11":"","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/stressfreefullenglis_67721","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52944","strMeal":"Escovitch Fish","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Seafood","strArea":"Jamaican","strInstructions":"Rinse fish; rub with lemon or lime, seasoned with salt and pepper or use your favorite seasoning.

Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the package directions. The pasta should be tender but still chewy.\r\n2. While the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.\r\n3. Drain the pasta in a colander. Place the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat and add the butter. When the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute. Watch carefully so it does not scorch on the bottom of the pan.\r\n4. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into the flour mixture until everything is really well combined. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Then stir in the drained cooked pasta.\r\n5. Line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter. Pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. Coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\nMake the grilled cheese\r\n6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.\r\n7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended.\r\n8. Remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Carefully cut into 8 equal pieces. Each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (You can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.)\r\n9. Spread 3/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. Place half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. Top each with one slice of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (Transfer from the baking sheet by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each. Finish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up.\r\n10. Using a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. Cover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more.\r\n11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Cut the sandwiches in half, if desired, and serve.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xutquv1505330523.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYq31xLj-DY","strIngredient1":"Macaroni","strIngredient2":"Plain Flour","strIngredient3":"Mustard Powder","strIngredient4":"Garlic powder","strIngredient5":"Kosher salt","strIngredient6":"Black pepper","strIngredient7":"Cayenne pepper","strIngredient8":"Butter","strIngredient9":"Whole Milk","strIngredient10":"Heavy Cream","strIngredient11":"Monterey Jack Cheese","strIngredient12":"Butter","strIngredient13":"garlic powder","strIngredient14":"Bread","strIngredient15":"Cheddar Cheese","strIngredient16":"Colby Jack Cheese","strIngredient17":"Butter","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"8 ounces (230 grams)","strMeasure2":"1/3 cup","strMeasure3":"3/4 teaspoon","strMeasure4":"1/2 teaspoon","strMeasure5":"1/2 teaspoon","strMeasure6":"1/2 teaspoon","strMeasure7":"1/8 teaspoon","strMeasure8":"6 tablespoons (85 grams)","strMeasure9":"1 1/2 cups (360 milliliters)","strMeasure10":"1 cup (240 milliliters)","strMeasure11":"1 pound (455 grams) ","strMeasure12":"4 tablespoons (55 grams)","strMeasure13":"1 teaspoon","strMeasure14":"16 slices square","strMeasure15":"8 slices mild","strMeasure16":"8 slices","strMeasure17":"4 tablespoons (55 grams)","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://leitesculinaria.com/103647/recipes-grilled-mac-and-cheese-sandwich.html","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52951","strMeal":"General Tsos Chicken","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Chicken","strArea":"Chinese","strInstructions":"DIRECTIONS:\r\nSTEP 1 - SAUCE\r\nIn a bowl, add 2 Cups of water, 2 Tablespoon soy sauce, 2 Tablespoon white vinegar, sherry cooking wine, 1/4 Teaspoon white pepper, minced ginger, minced garlic, hot pepper, ketchup, hoisin sauce, and sugar.\r\nMix together well and set aside.\r\nSTEP 2 - MARINATING THE CHICKEN\r\nIn a bowl, add the chicken, 1 pinch of salt, 1 pinch of white pepper, 2 egg whites, and 3 Tablespoon of corn starch\r\nSTEP 3 - DEEP FRY THE CHICKEN\r\nDeep fry the chicken at 350 degrees for 3-4 minutes or until it is golden brown and loosen up the chicken so that they don't stick together.\r\nSet the chicken aside.\r\nSTEP 4 - STIR FRY\r\nAdd the sauce to the wok and then the broccoli and wait until it is boiling.\r\nTo thicken the sauce, whisk together 2 Tablespoon of cornstarch and 4 Tablespoon of water in a bowl and slowly add to your stir-fry until it's the right thickness.\r\nNext add in the chicken and stir-fry for a minute and serve on a plate","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/1529444113.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWGwz0iBmvU","strIngredient1":"Chicken Breast","strIngredient2":"Plain Flour","strIngredient3":"Egg","strIngredient4":"Starch","strIngredient5":"Baking Powder","strIngredient6":"Salt","strIngredient7":"Onion Salt","strIngredient8":"Garlic Powder","strIngredient9":"Water","strIngredient10":"Chicken Stock","strIngredient11":"Duck Sauce","strIngredient12":"Soy Sauce","strIngredient13":"Honey","strIngredient14":"Rice Vinegar","strIngredient15":"Sesame Seed Oil","strIngredient16":"Gochujang","strIngredient17":"Starch","strIngredient18":"Garlic","strIngredient19":"Spring Onions","strIngredient20":"Ginger","strMeasure1":"1 1/2 ","strMeasure2":"3/4 cup ","strMeasure3":"1","strMeasure4":"2 tbs","strMeasure5":"1 tbs","strMeasure6":"1 tsp ","strMeasure7":"1/2 tsp","strMeasure8":"1/4 tsp","strMeasure9":"3/4 cup ","strMeasure10":"1/2 cup ","strMeasure11":"1/4 cup","strMeasure12":"3 tbs","strMeasure13":"2 tbs","strMeasure14":"1 tbs","strMeasure15":"2 tbs","strMeasure16":"1/2 tbs","strMeasure17":"2 tbs","strMeasure18":"1 clove","strMeasure19":"2 chopped","strMeasure20":"1 tsp ","strSource":"https://www.skinnytaste.com/general-tsos-chicken/","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"53012","strMeal":"Gigantes Plaki","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Vegetarian","strArea":"Greek","strInstructions":"Soak the beans overnight in plenty of water.

Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water, and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times until the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don’t overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky.\r\nOn a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm. Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold, then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.\r\nTo make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.\r\nTo make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it’s just a little thicker than a £1 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place on a baking tray.
